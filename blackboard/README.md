# Blackboard {#blackboard}

Blackboard is the home to a majority of the course materials used by faculty across the university. The week-by-week breakdown of the key components that you need to master are listed in the sidebar to the left. It is vital that you grasp and understand these concepts to be able to help clients in-person, on the phone, or via email. If you have questions about any of the topics covered, ask another student assistants or an Instructional Designer.
